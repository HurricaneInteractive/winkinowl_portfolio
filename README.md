Personal website I coded up in about 6 hours, it is completely static, just wanted to get something out there. Can be viewed here. [WinkingOwl Digital](http://winkingowl.digital/). The logo is mine and I am using it for Freelance work so please don't use it for your own personal work. Other icons are all good to be reused :D

### Getting Started
Run `yarn` or `npm` to install all the node_modules, after you Fork and Clone the repo. Uses some PHP so using something like XAMPP would be useful.

### Scss
Running the `grunt` command will compile and watch for any SCSS updates. Check out [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) for more information.
